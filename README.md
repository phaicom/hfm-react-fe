## ESLint Configuration

This project uses my custom eslint rule [eslint-config
](https://github.com/phaicom/eslint-config)
For it to work, install the recommended VS Code extensions. The code will be formatted by Eslint once the file is saved.

## PS

Some file like data and hooks that I didn't seperate into global folder because It's not use in others file and I want to group related feature together.
